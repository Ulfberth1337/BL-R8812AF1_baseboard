This is a baseboard for BL-R8812AF1 WI-FI Module.
USB and Power can be suplied by USB TYPE-C connector or by using TH Pads.
Power requirments are 5V +/- 5% and current 1A.
Baseboard got resetable fuse in order to protect power supply from short circuit and reverse polarity protection.

!!! USE AT OWN RISK !!!

UPD reverse polarity protection part will not work, I mixed up source with drain on mosfet.
The rest of the board works fine.
